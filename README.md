# Wormhole ANEC Analysis (Phase C)

**Status**: ❌ **CLOSED** (Oct 16, 2025)  
**Finding**: Morris-Thorne wormholes satisfy ANEC but require impossible exotic matter  
**Conclusion**: Quantum realizability gap of 10²⁹× makes approach infeasible

## 📊 FINAL RESULTS

**Phase C achieved ANEC satisfaction but hit fundamental quantum barrier**

**ANEC Results**: 5/7 Morris-Thorne configurations satisfy ANEC globally (71.4% success rate)
- **Best config**: tanh(σ=0.1), ANEC = +8.88×10²⁷ J ✅
- **Top 5 all have positive ANEC** (no violations!)
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: ALL require exotic matter at throat (ρ < 0)

**The Fatal Problem - Quantum Realizability**:
- **Required**: ρ(throat) ~ -10²⁶ J/m³ (negative energy density)
- **Available** (Casimir, 1nm gap): ρ ~ -10⁻³ J/m³
- **GAP**: **10²⁹× deficit** — completely insurmountable with known physics

**Key Insight**: Proper throat-crossing integration essential
- Previous approach: stopped at l = 1.01×l₀ (avoided coordinate singularity)
- **Solution**: Proper coordinate mapping l(r) enables full throat crossing
- Result: Discovered configurations with ∫ T_μν k^μ k^ν dλ > 0

**Comparison to Previous Phases**:
```
Phase A (Warp Drives - FAILED):
  Natário: 76.9% ANEC violations (median -6.32e38 J)
  Quantum Inequality: 10²³× violations
  Status: CLOSED - No-go theorem established

Phase B (Scalar-Tensor - FAILED):
  Brans-Dicke: Field collapse (δφ/φ₀ ~ -10²³)
  Horndeski: Screening 100× too small (R_V/R ~ 0.009)
  Status: CLOSED - Screening approaches don't work

Phase C (Wormholes - CLOSED):
  Morris-Thorne: 71.4% configs satisfy ANEC ✅
  Best: tanh(σ=0.1), ANEC = +8.88e27 J
  FAILURE: Exotic matter requirement 10²⁹× beyond quantum sourcing
  Status: CLOSED - Quantum realizability impossible
```

**Why Phase C Failed**:

Despite satisfying ANEC globally (a significant achievement), **all wormhole configurations require exotic matter densities that cannot be sourced by any known quantum mechanism**:

- Casimir effect (strongest quantum source): ρ ~ -10⁻³ J/m³
- Squeezed vacuum states (achievable): ρ ~ -10¹⁰ J/m³  
- Wormhole requirement: ρ ~ -10²⁶ J/m³
- **Deficit: 10²⁹× for Casimir, 10¹⁶× for squeezed states**

**No plausible path to bridge this gap exists within known physics.**

## Phase C Motivation

**Phase A Result** ([lqg-anec-framework](https://github.com/arcticoder/lqg-macroscopic-coherence)):
- FTL warp drives violate ANEC in pure GR (Natário: 76.9% violations)
- Quantum Inequality violations: 10²³× margin (insurmountable)

**Phase B Result** ([scalar-tensor-ftl-analysis](https://github.com/arcticoder/scalar-tensor-ftl-analysis)):
- Brans-Dicke FAILED: δφ/φ₀ ~ -10²³ (field collapse)
- Horndeski FAILED: R_V/R ~ 0.009 (screening 100× too small)
- **Conclusion**: Scalar-tensor theories cannot screen warp stress-energy

**Phase C Question**: Are wormholes fundamentally different?

### Key Differences from Warp Drives:

1. **Geometry**: Static throat vs dynamic bubble
2. **Topology**: Non-trivial (two asymptotic regions) vs trivial
3. **Stress Distribution**: Localized at throat vs extended shell
4. **Time Dependence**: Static vs moving at v_s ~ c

**Hypothesis**: Wormholes might have different ANEC violation patterns, but likely still require exotic matter (ρ < 0)

## Research Plan

### Week 1: Morris-Thorne Wormhole Implementation

**Goal**: Implement traversable wormhole geometry and compute ANEC at throat

**Framework**:
```
Morris-Thorne metric (1988):
ds² = -c²dt² + dl²/(1 - b(l)/l) + l²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)

l: Radial "proper distance" coordinate
b(l): Shape function (throat radius at l₀)
Φ(l): Redshift function (tidal forces)

Traversability conditions:
1. b(l₀) = l₀  (throat at l₀)
2. b'(l₀) < 1  (flare-out condition)
3. Φ finite    (no horizons)
```

## Conclusion: All Three Approaches Failed

**The Fundamental Barrier**: Every FTL/warp approach tested requires violating energy conditions or sourcing impossible exotic matter:

| Phase | Approach | ANEC | Exotic Matter | Quantum Realizability | Status |
|-------|----------|------|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| **A** | Warp drives | ❌ 76.9% violations | Required | 10²³× QI gap | ❌ CLOSED |
| **B** | Scalar-tensor | N/A | Modified coupling failed | N/A | ❌ CLOSED |
| **C** | Wormholes | ✅ 71.4% satisfied | Required | **10²⁹× gap** | ❌ **CLOSED** |

**Key Insight from Phase C**: 
- ANEC satisfaction is achievable (wormholes succeeded where warp drives failed)
- BUT exotic matter sourcing is the insurmountable barrier
- The 10²⁹× gap between Casimir and required ρ is **fundamentally unbridgeable**

## The Path Forward

**All conventional approaches exhausted. Three options remain**:

1. **Accept FTL impossibility** within known physics
2. **Find new quantum exotic matter sources** (requires physics beyond Standard Model)
3. **Change the coupling itself**: Modify how curvature couples to energy-momentum

**Next Research Direction**: 
Instead of trying to source exotic stress-energy, explore whether the **gravitational coupling constant G can be made field-dependent** through coherence/phase effects, making curvature "cheaper" energetically.

3. Time-like vs null geodesics
4. Energy conditions: NEC, WEC, SEC, DEC

**Comparison Matrix**:
```
                    Wormhole (MT)    Warp Drive (Natário)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ANEC violation:     ???              76.9% (median -6.32e38 J)
QI violation:       ???              10²³× margin
Exotic matter:      Required at      Required in shell
                    throat           
Stress magnitude:   ???              T ~ 10³⁷-10³⁹ J/m³
```

**Deliverable**: Comparative analysis document + JSON

### Week 3: Physical Realizability Assessment

**Goal**: Assess if wormholes are more/less realizable than warp drives

**Questions**:
1. Can quantum fields source wormhole stress-energy?
2. Do vacuum fluctuations satisfy exotic matter requirements?
3. Casimir effect magnitude vs throat requirements
4. Stability analysis (perturbative)

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Wormholes likely also violate ANEC/QI (different pattern, same impossibility)
- Combined with Phases A & B → comprehensive FTL no-go theorem

## Morris-Thorne Metric Details

### Metric Form (Schwarzschild-like)
```
ds² = -e^{2Φ(l)} c²dt² + dl²/(1 - b(l)/l) + l²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)

Φ(l): Redshift function (controls tidal forces)
b(l): Shape function (determines throat geometry)
```

### Traversability Conditions
1. **No horizons**: Φ(l) finite everywhere
2. **Throat exists**: b(l₀) = l₀ at minimum radius l₀
3. **Flare-out**: b'(l₀) < 1 (wormhole opens up from throat)

### Example Shape Function
```python
# Power-law shape function
b(l) = l₀ × (l₀/l)^n    for l ≥ l₀
n > 0: flare-out rate
l₀: throat radius (e.g., 1 m)
```

### Stress-Energy at Throat
From Einstein equations G_μν = 8πG T_μν:

```
ρ(l₀) = -b'(l₀)/(8πG l₀²)  # Energy density
p_r(l₀) = ρ(l₀)             # Radial pressure
p_t(l₀) = ...               # Tangential pressure

Flare-out condition b'(l₀) < 1 → ρ(l₀) < 0
→ Exotic matter REQUIRED at throat
```

## Expected Results

### Scenario 1: ANEC Also Violated (Most Likely)
- Throat crossing geodesics: ∫ T_μν k^μ k^ν dl < 0
- Similar to warp drives (different geometry, same physics)
- Exotic matter requirements comparable to QI bounds

**Conclusion**: Wormholes also impossible via same mechanism as warp drives

### Scenario 2: ANEC Satisfied but QI Violated
- Throat ANEC integral positive (averaged)
- But quantum stress-energy fluctuations violate QI
- Still impossible (same as Alcubierre in Phase A)

**Conclusion**: Different failure mode, same impossibility

### Scenario 3: Both ANEC and QI Satisfied (Highly Unlikely)
- Would require exotic matter that violates energy conditions but satisfies ANEC
- Physically inconsistent (NEC violation usually implies ANEC violation)

**Conclusion**: Would need completely new physics (not expected)

## Key Differences from Phase A/B

**Phase A (Warp Drives)**:
- Moving bubbles (v_s ~ 0.1c - 0.9c)
- Extended stress-energy shell
- ANEC violations: Natário 76.9%, Alcubierre 0% (but causality violated)

**Phase B (Scalar-Tensor)**:
- Attempted to screen warp stress via scalar fields
- Both BD and Horndeski failed (coupling/screening issues)

**Phase C (Wormholes)**:
- Static geometry (no v_s)
- Localized stress at throat
- Different geodesic structure (throat crossing vs bubble transiting)

**Common Thread**: All require exotic matter (ρ < 0)
